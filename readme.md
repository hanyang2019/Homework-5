## __Findings__
1.	The prevalence of Pyber in a city correlates with its extent of urbanization. People in urban cities are more likely to take Pyber rides than those in suburban and rural cities. 
2.	There are much more Pyber drivers in urban cities than the other two city types combined.
3.	Rural riders tend to spend more money on a single ride than riders in urban and suburban cities.

## __Findings__
1.	Only two, capomulin and ramicane, out of 10 drugs have successfully reduced the total tumor volume in mice.
2.	Ramicane, followed by capomulin, showed the strongest capacity to reduce metastasis in comparison to other treatments.
3.	Both capomulin and ramicane out-ranked other treatments in terms of survival rate.
